# Robson
When you and your teammates are on the road, it's hard to predict where you'll be when meetings happen, and even harder to control the environment. Laptops don't work very well for conferences, cell phone speakers and Bluetooth boom boxes aren't much better. Robson is a VoIP conferencing solution with integrated WiFi and LTE that is the size of (and doubles as!) a hotspot, connects multiple Auracast(TM) compatible headsets and has crystal clear integrated sound through its surround microphone array, 3W speaker and sophisticated noise reduction. It features a high capacity LiPo battery and fast charging through its USB-C port. It can also charge a device when not in a call.  

Robson is an arful marriage of IoT and portable audio, combining the Nordic Semiconductor nRF9160 CAT-M SoC as the main processor, an nRF5340 LE Audio SoC and the ESP32 WiFi/BT SoC for high bandwidth connectivity and compatibility with Bluetooth Classic headsets. This repository contains the high level hardware architecture and firmware design documents, along with prototype firmware for the respective development kits for the three SoCs:
* Nordic Semiconductor nRF9160-DK
* Nordic Semiconductor nRF5340 Audio DK
* ESP-WROOM-32
