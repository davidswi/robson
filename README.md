# Robson
When you and your teammates are on the road, it's hard to predict where you'll be when meetings happen, and even harder to control the environment. Laptops don't work very well for conferences, cell phone speakers and Bluetooth boom boxes aren't much better. Robson is a VoIP conferencing solution with integrated WiFi and LTE that is the size of (and doubles as!) a hotspot, connects multiple Auracast(TM) compatible headsets and has crystal clear integrated sound through its surround microphone array, 3W speaker and sophisticated noise reduction. It features a high capacity LiPo battery and fast charging through its USB-C port. It can also charge a device when not in a call.  

Robson is an arful marriage of IoT and portable audio, combining the Quectel BG95 Cat-M LTE module, an nRF5340 LE Audio SoC as the main processor and the Dialog DA16200 WiFi SoC for high bandwidth connectivity. This repository contains the high level hardware architecture and firmware design documents, along with prototype firmware for the following development kits:
* Waveshare Quectel BG95-M3 Zero
* Nordic Semiconductor nRF5340 Audio DK
* SparkFun Thing Plus - DA16200
